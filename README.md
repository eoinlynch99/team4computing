This code was used in the Team Computing Module in First year of Computer Science Infrastrcutre.
The point of this code was to make a LEGO Mindstorm navigate through a Maze.


How the Work Was Divided Among the Team

Every week the team would arrive in class and set up our robot. After this was done we would 
then decide on the tasks that we would like to solve and how we would go about solving the 
tasks. The way the team divided the work was simple, both team members attempted to work 
at once with one member coding and one researching. This led to the team becoming efficient 
at learning functions and implementing new functions as both team members would have 
experience with them. In terms of testing the robot the same approach was taken, both team 
members would observe the robot’s behaviour and make comments and suggestions on how 
the team would improve its behaviour in order for it to complete its goal. In summary, the team 
divided its work half and half as both members got experience coding and researching.


Lessons Learned During the Project

The team have learned many lessons during this project and one that stood out to the team was 
our ability to work well as a team. The team communicated well together and made a very solid 
effort at completing the projects goals. The team generally enjoyed working on this project 
but it has also taught us a valuable lesson about working as a team and time efficiency. One 
large lesson the team has learned is that sometimes you need to put aside everything else for a 
while and focus on the task at hand. The team began to struggle near the end of the project as 
the team found it difficult to compete our goals. The team now knows the importance of getting 
as much work possibly done as both members would have liked to have more code typed for 
the project and more tasks completed.


Test Plan to Prepare the Robot

At the start of our project the team wrote a design document where each week’s tasks where 
planned. The team believed then that the schedule would work flawlessly and that the team 
would have the robot fully completed on schedule. Unfortunately, the team struggled with 
completing some of the tasks that both members had set out for themselves. The team started
to run out of time towards the end of the semester and that forced the team to not get every task 
100% completed but both members inputted a solid effort into attempting to complete the tasks 
set out for them.

The team managed to get code working well for counting the different coloured boxes and 
counting lines, as well as the robot traversing the grid up to a point which both members are 
satisfied with. The team would have preferred a little more time to perfect our robot because 
of the length of time it took to complete some of the tasks that were set out, but both members 
managed to do the best they could on the tasks.
